# plot3d

Having the three axes data a three dimensional animated plot gets generated.
Points can have different colours based on the cluster they are in, and different shape if they are misclassified instances.


## USAGE
```
x = x axis,
y = y axis,
z = z axis,
groups = found clusters,
truth = actual clusters,
axis_n = vector of labels

plot_3d(x,y,z, groups, truth, axis_n)
```
